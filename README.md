# Plot-Twist
Plot Twist is a multiplayer board game that you can play in your browser.  
You can select from 4 rooms to join with people and then begin a game session.

The front-end is built with AngularJS (1.66) and PhaserIO, while the back-end is built with NodeJS.
SocketIO is used to relay messages between the front-end and back-end in real time.  

To run it locally, download/clone this repository and run:
npm install
as well as
bower install
